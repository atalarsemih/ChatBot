Project Name - Chatbot

## Project Description

This project contains a chatbot developed using the Cleverbotfree library. The chatbot takes input text from users and generates responses using an artificial intelligence model.

## Installation

After downloading the project files, you can run the chatbot by following these steps:

1. Python should be installed.
2. Clone the project or download and extract the ZIP file.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Install the Cleverbot library by running the command `pip install cleverbotfree`.
5. Start the chatbot by running the command `python your_script_name.py`.

## Usage

Once the chatbot is started, users can type the text they want to input. The chatbot analyzes the text and produces appropriate responses. You can exit the chatbot by using the "quit" command.

```python
from cleverbotfree import Cleverbot

@Cleverbot.connect
def chat(bot,user_prompt,bot_prompt):
    while True:
        user_input = input(user_prompt)
        if user_input == "quit":
            break
        reply = bot.single_exchange(user_input)
        print(bot_prompt, reply)
        bot_reply_eng
        speak(bot_reply_eng)

chat("Me","Jarvis")
```
